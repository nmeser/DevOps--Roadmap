## [Running a HTTPS Python Server on EC2 in 5 Minutes](https://pancy.medium.com/running-a-https-python-server-on-ec2-in-5-minutes-6c1f0444a0cf)
Here Iâ€™m going to walk you through setting up a running HTTPS API server in Python using FastAPI (trust me, Flask is so 2008) and Caddy web server (this one is a total replacement to NGINX and gives you automatic HTTPS, saving you from the pain of setting up TLS certificate).

[AWS Solution Architect Professional â€” Exam tips -2021](https://medium.com/startcloudnow/aws-solution-architect-professional-exam-tips-2021-9dee760f20ec)

I recently had to recertify my AWS Solution Architect Professional exam. AWS is very nice in that they give you three years to recertify. Even though itâ€™s three years preparing for recertification can be stressful. If you choose not to recertify I can understand but if you plan on keeping it well let just say on AWS a lot of things change fast.<br>

My preparation for this exam was very very stressful mainly because I had done a series of exams in December 2020 and this was my first for 2021 so my brain needed a rest. This exam is the real deal it covers the full gambit. From my experience, this is the rabbit hole I had to face. It covered topics like, storage, analytics, networking, compute, database types, migration, security both services and policy, serverless, Amazon FSx, API stuff, Appsec, Organisations, IAM, and more.
