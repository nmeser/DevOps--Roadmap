[Kubernetes explained deep enough](https://itnext.io/kubernetes-explained-deep-enough-1ea2c6821501)<br>
Why another Kubernetes series?
As the popularity of Kubernetes grows, so does the number of great online resources and learning materials. A lot of available information is either designed for absolute beginners or does a very deep dive into a specific topic.<br>

My goal is to write about Kubernetes topics in a practical way, like storage, deployments, services etc and provide exercises scenarios for everyone to follow along. The idea is to focus on the core functionality, understand it well enough and exercise along. If you already watched a few tutorials and maybe created pod or deployment and are ready for the next level, this series is for you.
